Terraform AWS Automation
Project Overview
This project automates the process of creating key AWS resources using Terraform. The project provisions the following resources:

IAM Role & Policy: A role with associated permissions that can be assumed by AWS services, along with a policy that grants access to Amazon S3.

S3 Bucket: A secure, versioned, encrypted S3 bucket with public access blocks to protect sensitive data.

VPC & Subnets: A custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets, along with security groups to control network access.

This project is intended to help automate infrastructure provisioning on AWS, making it easy to deploy resources in a repeatable and predictable manner.

Technologies Used
Terraform: An open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used for automating the provisioning of AWS resources.

AWS IAM: AWS Identity and Access Management to create roles and policies.

Amazon S3: A scalable cloud storage service used for storing data.

Amazon VPC: Virtual Private Cloud, a logically isolated network in AWS for secure resource deployment.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Terraform: Ensure you have Terraform installed. If not, you can install it from Terraform Downloads.

AWS CLI: Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials. You can install it from AWS CLI Installation.

AWS Account: You must have an active AWS account. Set up IAM roles and policies according to your organizational standards.

Steps to Deploy Resources:
Clone the Repository:
If you don't have the repository yet, clone it to your local machine.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/terraform-aws-automation.git
cd terraform-aws-automation
Set AWS Credentials:
Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured either in the environment variables or by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws configure
Initialize Terraform:
Initialize the Terraform working directory. This will download the required provider plugins and initialize the environment.

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
Review the Plan:
You can run the following command to see a preview of the changes Terraform will make to your AWS environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
Apply the Configuration:
Apply the configuration to provision resources on AWS. Type yes when prompted to confirm the action.

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply
Confirm Resources:
Go to the AWS Management Console to confirm the resources have been created:

IAM: Verify the role and policy are created.

S3: Check that your S3 bucket is available and secured.

VPC: Confirm the VPC, subnets, and security groups have been created.

Expected Outputs
When the terraform apply command completes successfully, you should see the following outputs in the terminal:

S3 Bucket Name: The name of the created S3 bucket.

VPC ID: The ID of the created VPC.

Public Subnet ID: The ID of the created public subnet.

Private Subnet ID: The ID of the created private subnet.

Example Output:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

s3_bucket_name = "unique-terraform-bucket-name"
vpc_id = "vpc-12345678"
public_subnet_id = "subnet-12345678"
private_subnet_id = "subnet-87654321"
You can also use the terraform output command to retrieve these values later:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform output s3_bucket_name
terraform output vpc_id
terraform output public_subnet_id
terraform output private_subnet_id
Cleanup
To destroy the resources you created, run the following command to remove all resources provisioned by Terraform:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy
Confirm the destruction by typing yes when prompted.

Conclusion
This project automates the creation of critical AWS resources using Terraform, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure as code. By following the setup instructions, you can quickly provision IAM roles, S3 buckets, and VPC configurations with minimal manual effort.

This README.md file provides the essential information to understand, set up, and use the Terraform project. It's a standard practice to document infrastructure automation projects for clarity and ease of use. Feel free to modify and adapt this to fit any additional configurations or specific needs you may have.
